# Coroner

A plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission Performance Report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players. There are some fun easter eggs thrown in too.

Built for Lethal Company v45.

**NOTE:** [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is an optional but recommended dependency. Certain causes of death will fail to syncronize between clients in some circumstances but LC_API fixes this issue.

# Localization

Starting with version 1.5.0, Coroner now has support for multiple languages! Open the mod's config file (or use the Config Editor in R2Modman) to choose your desired language.

Side note, custom language files placed in the plugin folder should work, just make sure you specify your language code in the config.
