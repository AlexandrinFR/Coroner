# Coroner
A Lethal Company plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission performance report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players with some fun easter eggs thrown in too. Available to download from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/) or view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner).

> **NOTE:** If you have issues when using foreign language fonts, install FontFixer via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer) BEFORE reporting.

# Languages
As of v1.5.0, Coroner has support for multiple languages, and you're able to create your own translations if they're inaccurate or your language isn't available! To choose your language, open the config file for the mod (or use the [Thunderstore app](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)/[R2modman](https://r2modman.net/) config editor). For more information on translations, or how to add/edit your language, please check [`TRANSLATION.md`](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md).
