# Translating

In order to create a translation, copy the Strings_en.xml file and change the file name to replace the `en` with your language's code from [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code). A list of these codes can be easily found and searched via [this list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes). It's best to copy from the English translation as it will always be the most up to date version of the translation values. If your language isn't apart of ISO 639-1, choose a two-character code which most accurately represents your language, provided it isn't already used in ISO 639-1.

# Custom Translations

If you're trying to create your own variation of an already added language, or a custom language, any code (which can be comprised of any length of characters) will work provided that you specify that code in the mod's configuration file.
